# PHP-Programs
I have covered almost all important PHP concepts.
 
## Here’s a short summary of your PHP programs:-

I have worked on PHP basics, including data types (string, integer, float, boolean, array, object, etc.) and arrays (indexed, associative, and multidimensional). You also implemented cookies and sessions to store user data temporarily or across multiple pages.

### Features  
- PHP Basics (Variables, Data Types, Operators)  
- Arrays (Indexed, Associative, Multidimensional)  
- Forms (GET & POST Methods)  
- Cookies & Sessions  
- Database (CRUD Operations with MySQL)  


Programs also include GET and POST methods, handling form data securely and efficiently. With forms, you’ve explored validation and submission techniques. also worked on PHP with databases (MySQL), performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using SQL queries and PHP’s MySQLi or PDO.

Overall,I work in PHP covers core concepts that are essential for dynamic web development.
